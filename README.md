üöÄ Project Title & Tagline
==========================

**Project Title:** Node.js Project with Redux, Axios, and Tailwind CSS
**Tagline:** A modern Node.js project built with Redux, Axios, and Tailwind CSS, featuring a scalable and maintainable architecture.

üìñ Description
---------------

Welcome to our Node.js project, a comprehensive and easily maintainable application built with modern technologies such as Redux, Axios, and Tailwind CSS. This project is designed to showcase a scalable and maintainable architecture, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Redux is a state management library that helps to manage global state by using a single source of truth. Axios is a popular HTTP client that simplifies the handling of HTTP requests and responses. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling and customization of our application.

In this project, we have built a video creator application that allows administrators to create, save, and delete videos. The application is built with a clean and modular architecture, making it easy to maintain and extend.

‚ú® Features
------------

1. **Redux-based state management**: Global state is managed using Redux, making it easy to track and manage changes.
2. **Axios-based HTTP requests**: Axios is used to simplify the handling of HTTP requests and responses.
3. **Tailwind CSS styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for rapid styling and customization of the application.
4. **Video creator application**: Administrators can create, save, and delete videos using the application.
5. **User authentication**: Users are authenticated using JWT tokens and Redis.
6. **Error handling**: Errors are handled using a centralized error handling mechanism.
7. **Code organization**: Code is organized into clean and modular folders, making it easy to maintain and extend.
8. **ESLint configuration**: ESLint is configured to ensure code quality and consistency.
9. **Vite configuration**: Vite is configured to enable hot reloading and rapid development.
10. **Redis integration**: Redis is used as a caching layer to improve performance and scalability.
